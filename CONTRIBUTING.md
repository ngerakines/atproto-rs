# Contributing

There are lots of ways to contribute:

* The core project and it's components.
* Documentation and community support
* Spreading the word
* Financially through GitHub sponsorship or by buying me a cup of coffee

To get started, go to github.com/ngerakines/atproto-rs start looking through open issues, pull-requests, and the codebase.

When reporting bugs, please describe what you encountered, what you did to get there, and what you expect to happen.
